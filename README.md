# Code-Coverage-Using-Java-Plugins
Developed solution for improvimg code coverage for any production code using eclipse plugins
Worked solely on the project and completed it in 2 weeks </br>

# Project Status: Done
# Project Documentation: In-Process
So much occupied with the office work, will complete the documentation soon.
This is kinda project report that I have to submit to my college for 8th sem evaluation.</br>

# Description: 
To find APIs for untested methods through code. Code coverage improved by 95% after the work has been completed. I wrote a script in java which automatically finds the callers for the untested methods and ultimately finds its annotations to hit those methods through APIs if it exists or else marks it as deprecated and handed over the results to QA for hitting those APIs through tests.</br>

# About Code Written
Actual code written for the project is different from the one shared above, have modified it a lot to find callers for IMethods by passing method name, class name and package name to its function and then further it finds callers for the found caller methods and the process goes on until it finds the annotations for the method or all the callers in the list for given method have been explored</br>
