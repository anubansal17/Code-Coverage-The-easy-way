# Code-Coverage-Using-Java-Plugins
Developed solution for doing code coverage for any production code written in java using eclipse plugins

# Project Status: Done
# Description: 
To find APIs for untested methods through code. Code coverage improved by 95% after the work has been completed. I wrote a script in java which automatically finds the callers for the untested methods and ultimately finds its annotations to hit those methods through APIs if it exists or else marks it as deprecated and handed over the results to QA for hitting those APIs through tests.
